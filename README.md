## Minimera

_A UX implementation project for KYH Yrkesh√∂gskola_

Minimera was a project to create a platform for sharing economy. Minimera is designed primarily for mobile devices and as such is best viewed through a screen around 425 pixels wide or lower. Minimera was created using react as a front-end and firebase as back end, as well as utilizing MUI and Emotion to provide styling for the site. This is still a build-version so some bugs might appear when running.

    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN="Your key here"
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL="Your key here",
    REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID="Your key here"
